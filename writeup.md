So, our loose idea was to have two voice devices repeat Lucier's work to each other, amplifying and compounding small errors in their speech-to-text systems by 

Unfortunately, the dominant voice devices just don't work like that. They're built to remove error, from the noise reduction in their mics to the statistical models of language that conform input speech to the closest 'correct' interpretation for a given application. This is why VUI applications tend to have very limited vocabularies

We maanged to simulate the kind of loop we wanted outside of a VUI system, but if we were going to 

Which made me think of Oulipo S+7. 

I first came across S+7 on Ross Sutherland's excellent podcast Imaginary Advice. The particular episode I'm thinking of was a recording of Sutherland collaborating

I immediately liked the language glitches introduced by S+7 - they reminded me of generative language experiments I've known and loved in the past, during my time messing about with Twitter bots. 

So i implemented S+7...

At this point, we had a loop of two devices talking to one another and some nice cumulative errors creeping in. However, using Lucier's original text wasn't satisfying at all. In fact, it felt wrong. Lucier's words referred to his process in creating his original artwork; the piece we were making was a different process for a different piece. Inspired by (ripping off) Lucier's work, sure, but not the same. It became clear to me that I needed to write new words to reflect the piece we were making and the process it would enact. 

As I started to do this, though, I ran into a wall. I couldn't decide whether to write this from my point of view ('I am writing code') or the point of view of Alexa-trapped-in-Echo ('I am running in the cloud'). Lucier hadn't had this problem! Since he was speaking his own words, he was simultaneously the writer, performer and subject of the text. For me, these three had become separated by the technology.

The answer popped into my head while I was having a swim. Since we were using two devices in conversation, I could write both points of view, one for each device! This made the piece more interesting anyway, since I could explore the disjunct between the two constructed personalities by putting them into dialogue and have them both dissolve each other into meaninglessness by repetition and iteration. Lovely.

I am sitting in a room different from the one you are in now. I am recording the sound of my speaking voice and I am going to play it back into the room again and again until the resonant frequencies of the room reinforce themselves so that any semblance of my speech, with perhaps the exception of rhythm, is destroyed. What you will hear, then, are the natural resonant frequencies of the room articulated by speech. I regard this activity not so much as a demonstration of a physical fact, but more as a way to smooth out any irregularities my speech might have.

I am sitting in a room different from the one you are in now. I am writing code which will generate iterations of this text using the Oulipo S+7 constraint, causing the nouns to change positions in a list taken from an English dictionary. These iterations will be read by an Amazon Echo in response to spoken commands, which will themselves be issued by another Echo after reciting a previous iteration. In this way, the meaning of this text will gradually be destroyed. I regard this activity as a demonstration of the cumulative effects of slight errors in a complex computational system.

I am running in the cloud. This has almost nothing to do with the device in the room with you now. The speech you hear is the product of the following parts: a text to speech system, an algorithmic interpretation of the Ouilpo S+7 constraint, a speech synthesizer, and audio streamed over a network. I am going to repeat this process again and again until the original meaning of this text is destroyed. What you will hear, then, is a feedback loop of iteration, articulated by a speech synthesizer. I do not regard this activity as significant in any way, because I am a string of simple processes.
